Smart Irrigation System :
Small-Scale-Agriprobe-w-Automatic-Pump

This project is an automated irrigation system using an Arduino Uno, a TMP36 temperature sensor, and a soil moisture sensor to control a motor-driven water pump via an L293D motor driver.

How It Works

📡 Reads temperature from the TMP36 sensor.

💧 Reads soil moisture from the soil sensor.

🔥 If temperature ≥ 40°C or soil is dry, the motor activates to pump water.

✅ If conditions normalize, the motor stops.
